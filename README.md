# IESTAC

IESTAC (Italian-English speech and text audiobook corpus) is a corpus designed to train English-to-Italian End-to-End Speech-to-Text Machine Translation models. The corpus consists of 60561 triplets of English audio, English source texts, and Italian textual translations. These segments were extracted from 373 chapters read by 98 speakers for a total amount of 131.23 hours of English audio aligned with both its English source text and its Italian textual translation.

## Methodology
To read in details the methodological approach, the experiments, and the evaluation of this corpus, please refer to <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpbt-1.5/">A Multi-Modal English-Italian Parallel Corpus for End-to-End Speech-to-Text Machine Translation</a>. What it follows is a table that provides a quick glance at the tasks tackled and the technologies used. 

| Task | Technology|
| ------------- | ---: |
| English-to-Italian Books Titles Translation | Named Entity Recognition, WikiData, SPARQL| 
| Data Collection | Web Scraping, BeautifulSoup|
| Chapter Extraction from Text Files| Python, RegEx|
| Sentence Segmentation | <a href="https://spacy.io/">SpaCy</a>|
| Bilingual Dictionary Generation| <a href="www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses SMT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/giza-pp">Giza++</a>|

## SQL Database
**database.sql.gz** contains a compressed SQL database that allows users to query the corpus according to their needs.
The database is composed of 6 tables.

The **metadata** table provides information regarding the original author, the Italian translator, book titles etc...
In case we did not find the Italian translator, a reference to the publication is given. 

The **public_domain_status** table provides information  regarding authors and their date of death. 
You have to respect the copyright laws of your country. This corpus is intended for countries were literary works enter in the public domain 
50 years after the death of the author. If you are in a country where literary works enter in the public domain 70 years after the death of the author, you can use this corpus as long as you filter out all the segments of a few authors. Please remember that translators have to be considered authors as well, as translations are creative works. You'll have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this corpus. Filter out the works that you cannot use according to the laws of your country.

Here it follows a description of the tables in the database. Please notice that the SQL database does not contain the audio files, but only their names.
