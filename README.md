# SST-Augmented-Audiobooks
STT-Aligned-Audiobooks (Speech, Text, Textual Translation, Aligned Audiobooks) is a corpus of around 130 hours of English audio utterances aligned with their English source texts and their Italian textual translations. The multimodal corpus can be used to train English-Italian End-to-End Speech Translation models, English ASR models, or statistical MT models. 

A binary file containing 60561 triplets of parallel English audio, English text, and Italian textual translation is available at https://www.kaggle.com/giuseppedellacorte/stt-aligned-audiobooks-en-it.
